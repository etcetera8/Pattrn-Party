              <p>And if we can do that - if we can embrace a common destiny - then I believe we'll not just help bring about a more hopeful
              day in America, we'll not just be caring for our own souls, we'll be doing God's work here on Earth. Because I've lived it.
              I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal, but I do believe
              that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality.</p>

              <p>I don't sit in while you're running it down. I'm going to get to ride the bike up, rob it, and ride the bank away. I wrote
              you everyday for a year. You just tell me what you want, and I'm gonna be that for you. I think the one thing I love most
              about being an adult is the right to buy candy whenever and wherever I want. If I drive for you, you get your money. I don't
              carry a gun. Because I was home-schooled, I didn't have a lot of friends and I did ballet, which was always just girls. There
              would be no cuts, real people in there, real tellers. You just have to hang out in places that are more interesting than
              you are.
